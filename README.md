# Molten

Molten is a fork of [Magma](https://www.github.com/dccsillag/molten-nvim), a plugin for running code interactively with the jupyter kernel.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm still in the process of renaming, and porting over changes. This plugin is not stable at this

## Requirements

- NeoVim 9.0+
- Python 3.10+
- Required Python packages:
  - [`pynvim`](https://github.com/neovim/pynvim) (for the Remote Plugin API)
  - [`jupyter_client`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client) (for interacting with Jupyter)
  - [`cairosvg`](https://cairosvg.org/) (for displaying SVG images)
  - [`pnglatex`](https://pypi.org/project/pnglatex/) (for displaying TeX formulas)
  - `plotly` and `kaleido` (for displaying Plotly figures)
  - `pyperclip` if you want to use `molten_copy_output`
- For .NET (C#, F#)
  - `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-interactive`
  - `dotnet interactive jupyter install`

You can do a `:checkhealth` to see if you are ready to go.

**Note:** Python packages which are used only for the display of some specific kind of output are only imported when that output actually appears.

## Quick-start

TODO: wiki link
See the [Wiki Quick-start Guide](https://www.github.com/benlubas/molten-nvim/wiki)

## Usage

The plugin provides a bunch of commands to enable interaction. It is recommended to map most of them to keys, as explained in [Keybindings](#keybindings). However, this section will refer to the commands by their names (so as to not depend on some specific mappings).

TODO wiki link
In-depth setup information can be found in the wiki

### Interface

When you execute some code, it will create a _cell_. You can recognize a cell because it will be highlighted when your cursor is in it.

A cell is delimited using two extmarks (see `:help api-extended-marks`), so it will adjust to you editing the text within it.

When your cursor is in a cell (i.e., you have an _active cell_), a floating window may be shown below the cell, reporting output. This is the _display window_, or _output window_. (To see more about whether a window is shown or not, see `:MoltenShowOutput` and `g:molten_auto_open_output`). When you cursor is not in any cell, no cell is active.

The active cell is chosen from newest to oldest. That means that you can have a cell within another cell, and if the one within is newer, then that one will be selected. (Same goes for merely overlapping cells).

The output window has a header, containing the execution count and execution state (i.e., whether the cell is waiting to be run, running, has finished successfully or has finished with an error). Below the header are shown the outputs.

Jupyter provides a rich set of outputs. To see what we can currently handle, see [Output Chunks](#output-chunks).

### Commands Reference

A list of the commands and their arguments. Args in `[]` are optional

| Command                  | Arguments             | Description                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `MoltenInit`              | `[kernel]`            | Initialize a kernel for the current buffer. If no kernel is given, prompts the user |
| `MoltenDeinit`            | none                  | De-initialize the current buffer's runtime and molten instance. (called automatically on vim close/buffer unload) |
| `MoltenEvaluateLine`      | none                  | Evaluate the current line |
| `MoltenEvaluateVisual`    | none                  | Evaluate the visual selection (**cannot be called with a range!**) |
| `MoltenEvaluateOperator`  | none                  | Evaluate text selected by the following operator. see [keymaps](#keymaps) for useage |
| `MoltenReevaluateCell`    | none                  | Re-evaluate the active cell (including new code) |
| `MoltenDelete`            | none                  | Delete the active cell (does nothing if there is no active cell) |
| `MoltenShowOutput`        | none                  | Shows the output window for the active cell |
| `MoltenHideOutput`        | none                  | Hide currently open output window |
| `MoltenEnterOutput`       | none                  | Move into the active cell's output window. **must be called with `noautocmd`** (see [keymaps](#keymaps) for example) |
| `MoltenInterrupt`         | none                  | Sends a keyboard interrupt to the kernel which stops any currently running code. (does nothing if there's no current output) |
| `MoltenRestart`           | `[!]`                 | Shuts down a restarts the current kernel. Deletes all outputs if used with a bang |
| `MoltenSave`              | `[path]`              | Save the current cells and evaluated outputs into a JSON file. When path is specified, save the file to `path`, otherwise save to `g:molten_save_path` |
| `MoltenLoad`              | `[path]`              | Loads cell locations and output from a JSON file generated by `MoltenSave`. path functions the same as `MoltenSave` |

## Keybindings

TODO: wiki link
The commands above should be mapped to keys for the best experience. There are more detailed setups
in the Wiki, but here are some example bindings. Pay attention to `MoltenEvaluateVisual` and
`MoltenEnterOutput`, as they require a little special attention

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>R", ":MoltenEvaluateOperator<CR>",
    { silent = true, desc = "run operator selection" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rl", ":MoltenEvaluateLine<CR>",
    { silent = true, desc = "evaluate line" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rc", ":MoltenReevaluateCell<CR>",
    { silent = true, desc = "re-evaluate cell" })
vim.keymap.set("v", "<localleader>r", ":<C-u>MoltenEvaluateVisual<CR>gv",
    { silent = true, desc = "evaluate visual selection" })
```

You can, of course, also map other commands:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rd", ":MoltenDelete<CR>",
    { silent = true, desc = "molten delete cell" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>ro", ":MoltenShowOutput<CR>",
    { silent = true, desc = "show output" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rq", ":noautocmd MoltenEnterOutput<CR>",
    { silent = true, desc = "enter output" })
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done with variables.

### `g:molten_enter_output_behavior`

Configures the behavior of [MoltenEnterOutput](#moltenenteroutput)

- `"open_then_enter"` (default) -- open the window if it's closed. Enter the window if it's already open
- `"open_and_enter"` -- open and enter the window if it's closed. Otherwise enter as normal
- `"no_open"` -- enter the window when it's open, do nothing if it's closed

### `g:molten_image_provider`

This configures how to display images. The following options are available:

- `"none"` (default) -- don't show images.
- `"image_nvim"` -- use the image nvim plugin

### `g:molten_auto_open_output`

If this is true, then whenever you have an active cell its output window will be automatically shown.
- `true` (default) -- when you have an active cell, its output window is automatically shown
- `false` -- Output only opens right after running the code, or after running `:MoltenShowOutput`

### `g:molten_wrap_output`

- `true` -- wrap text in output windows
- `false` (default) -- don't wrap text in output windows. This option allows for progress bars to
work properly

### `g:molten_output_window_border`

- `true` (default) -- output windows have a rounded border
- `false` -- output windows have no border

### `g:molten_cell_highlight_group`

The highlight group to be used for highlighting cells.

- `"CursorLine"` (default)

### `g:molten_save_path`

Where to save/load with `:MoltenSave` and `:MoltenLoad` (with no parameters).
The generated file is placed in this directory, with the filename itself being the buffer's name, with `%` replaced by `%%` and `/` replaced by `%`, and postfixed with the extension `.json`.

- `stdpath("data") .. "/molten"` (default)
- any path to a directory

### `g:molten_copy_output`

- `true` -- copy evaluation output to the clipboard automatically (requires `pyperclip`, see [requirements](#requirements))
- `false` (default) -- don't do that

### [DEBUG] `g:molten_show_mimetype_debug`

- `true` -- Before any non-iostream output chunk, the mime-type of that output chunk is shown. Meant for debugging/plugin development
- `false` (default) don't do that

## Autocommands

We provide some `User` autocommands (see `:help User`) for further customization. They are:

- `MoltenInitPre`: runs right before `MoltenInit` initialization happens for a buffer
- `MoltenInitPost`: runs right after `MoltenInit` initialization happens for a buffer
- `MoltenDeinitPre`: runs right before `MoltenDeinit` de-initialization happens for a buffer
- `MoltenDeinitPost`: runs right after `MoltenDeinit` de-initialization happens for a buffer

<details>
  <summary>Usage</summary>

There isn't very good documentation (at the time of writing) on using User Autocommands in lua, so
here is an example of attaching molten specific mappings to the buffer after initialization

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
  pattern = "MoltenInitPost",
  callback = function()
    vim.keymap.set("v", "<localleader>r", ":<C-u>MoltenEvaluateVisual<CR>gv",
      { desc = "execute visual selection", buffer = true, silent = true })
    -- more mappings here
  end,
})
```

Similarly, you could remove these mappings on `MoltenDeinitPost`

</details>

## Functions

### MoltenEvaluateRange

There is a provided function `MoltenEvaluateRange(start_line, end_line)` which evaluates the code
between the given line numbers (inclusive). This is intended for use in scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Example Usage</summary>

```lua
vim.fn.MoltenEvaluateRange(1, 23)
    ```

</details>

### MoltenUpdateOption

Because Molten is a remote plugin, options are loaded and cached at initialization. This avoids
making an unnecessary number of RPC calls if we were to fetch configuration values every time we
needed to use them. This comes with the trade-off of not being able to update config values on the
fly... can you see where this is going

This function lets you set a configuration value after initialization, and the new value will
effect immediately.

<details>
  <summary>Example Usage</summary>

```lua
-- these are the same!
vim.fn.MoltenUpdateOption("auto_open_output", true)
vim.fn.MoltenUpdateOption("molten_auto_open_output", true)
```

</details>

## Extras

### Output Chunks

In the Jupyter protocol, most output-related messages provide a dictionary of mime-types which can be used to display the data. Theoretically, a `text/plain` field (i.e., plain text) is always present, so we (theoretically) always have that fallback.

Here is a list of the currently handled mime-types:

- `text/plain`: Plain text. Shown as text in the output window's buffer.
- `image/png`: A PNG image. Shown according to `g:molten_image_provider`.
- `image/svg+xml`: A SVG image. Rendered into a PNG with [CairoSVG](https://cairosvg.org/) and shown with [Image.nvim](https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim).
- `application/vnd.plotly.v1+json`: A Plotly figure. Rendered into a PNG with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) + [Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido) and shown with [Image.nvim](https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim).
- `text/latex`: A LaTeX formula. Rendered into a PNG with [pnglatex](https://pypi.org/project/pnglatex/) and shown with [Image.nvim](https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim).

This already provides quite a bit of basic functionality, but if you find a use case for a mime-type that isn't currently supported, feel free to open an issue and/or PR!

### Notifications

We use the `vim.notify` API. This means that you can use plugins such as [rcarriga/nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify) for pretty notifications.
